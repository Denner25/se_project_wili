# WILI - Would I Like It?

This is the 16th and final project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen as well as my first creative project. It's an application where, by using the TMDB API, I allow users to search for their favorite movies and animes, and mark mood and genre descriptive boxes describing the specific aspects they like about their items, allowing for a deeper level of expression than just a list and generating a grid that appears in main and profile. Cards would are generated through engaging with the mood boxes rather than a like or favorite button.
There is a "Your top moods" section where I utilized react's wordcloud library to create a fun display that highlights the user's most marked moods in proportional size, random colors and arrangement upon every visit or change.
